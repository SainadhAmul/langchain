Langchain Exploration
an open-source framework that adds a new level of sophistication to your AI applications.

LangChain fills a crucial gap in the AI ecosystem by integrating large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-2, with external data sources. This extends the AI's knowledge beyond what was included in its last training session. For most models, that's only up until 2021, which could potentially leave a gap in its awareness of recent developments.
